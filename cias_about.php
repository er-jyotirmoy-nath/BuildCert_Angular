      <p>
      The longevity and efficiency of water heating primary circuits and boilers, including central heating systems, can be greatly improved by the use of chemical water treatment. The purpose of these treatment fluids in central heating systems is to:
      </p>  <ul>
					<li>inhibit corrosion of vital 
				metallic parts such as pipes and radiators,</li>
					<li>prevent scaling up of the 
				system, and in particular the boiler.</li>
				</ul>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-10">
    <br>
      <p>In addition the fluid should not cause damage to plastic and rubber components of the system and should have a low environmental impact.</p>
    
					<p>
						All chemical water treatment fluids certified by BuildCert are tested against the standard specification for the performance of chemical inhibitors for use in domestic hot water central heating systems drawn up by industry experts to ensure that inhibitors satisfy a minimum performance requirement. BuildCerts quality assurance requirements check that every bottle of water treatment fluid sold with the BuildCert CIAS logo on it performs as well as the last. BuildCert CIAS Approval allows boiler manufacturers, installers and consumers to have peace of mind that their hot water system are protected.

      <p>In April 2006 the revised Building Regulations including Approved Document L: Conservation of Fuel and Power (England and Wales) was published.  In addition the ODPM published Domestic Heating Compliance Guide to help users interpret the Approved Document. These are available at </p>

				http://www.communities.gov.uk/pub/340/DomesticHeatingComplianceGuide_id1165340.pdf</a></p>
				<p>
				The Domestic Heating Compliance Guide 
				specifically requires the use of chemical inhibitors both for 
				new build heating systems and when a new heat source (boiler) is 
				fitted to an existing heating system. The Guide also refers to 
				BS 7593:2006 Code of Practice for Treatment of Water in 
				Domestic Hot Water Central Heating Systems.</p>
				<p>
				The Guide states: Central heating systems should be thoroughly cleaned and flushed out before installing a new boiler.&nbsp; During final filling of a system, a chemical treatment formulation should be added to the primary circuit to control corrosion and the formation of scale and sludge. Reasonable provision would be to follow the guidance on how to prepare and commission systems given in BS 7593.</p>

  <p>
				To ensure that chemical inhibitors meet a 
				satisfactory performance requirement the manufacturers, 
				BuildCert and laboratories developed the CIAS Industry 
				Specification for the performance of Chemical Inhibitors for Use 
				in Domestic Hot Water Central Heating Systems (now May 2015).</p>
  <p>
				The Specification was first published in February 2006 and is now 
				being used as a benchmark for chemical inhibitor manufacturers 
				as a basis for developing chemical inhibitors and by BuildCert 
				to offer third party Certification.</p>
				<p>
				For a copy of the Specification

				Click Here</a>.<span lang="EN"> </span></p>
				<p>
					 
				Equipment manufacturers, installers and end 
				users can now be sure that BuildCert approved chemical 
				inhibitors will provide an effective resistance to corrosion 
				within a heating system when correctly used.</p>
				<p>
				Chemical inhibitors are tested in BuildCert 
				approved laboratories who test the inhibitor against the 
				exacting requirements of the BuildCert Domestic Water Treatment 
				Approval Scheme (CIAS) Specification for the performance of 
				Chemical Inhibitors for Use in Domestic Hot Water Central 
				Heating Systems.</p>
				<p>
				To ensure that BuildCert Certified products are suitable for 
				use, manufacturers are audited to verify that the contents of 
				every bottle of product supplied are identical to the samples 
				tested.</p>
				<p>
				Manufacturers are then audited to ensure that 
				every bottle of the product supplied is the same as the samples 
				tested, ensuring that all BuildCert Certified products will be 
				suitable for use.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

  <h2 class=" bg-info" style="padding:5px;">Notes on Quality Requirements</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers of Thermostatic mixing valves can demonstrate compliance by supplying the Scheme with a copy of a valid ISO 9001 certificate and scope of accreditation or an approved quality system. Where this cannot be supplied a quality audit will be conducted by the scheme to verify compliance with the requirements of the Scheme. </p>
  <p>
  A Primary factor is a company/individual who does not manufacture the valve but distributes a certified valve under his own trade name, the product having only cosmetic changes. An approval for the primary factor is sometimes referred to as a piggyback approval.
