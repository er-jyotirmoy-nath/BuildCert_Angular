      <p>The BuildCert approval Scheme requires the following as a pre-requisite for approval. </p>
    <ul>
			<li>All manufacturers and factors must have ISO 9001 accreditation 
			or be audited by BuildCert.</li>
			<li>All BuildCert approval holders must become a subscriber of the 
			BuildCert Scheme.</li>
			<li>The 
			Scheme requires 3 test valves be selected from a batch of thirty 
			production valves. If this is undertaken by an independent third 
			party then BuildCert will require confirmation in writing from that 
			third party.</li>
			<li>All valves must have WRAS approval before TMV3 approval can be 
			issued or the non-metallic materials in contact with water comply
			with the WRAS requirements or comply with BS6920.</li>
			<li>The installation and maintenance documents (I&amp;M) must include 
			information stated by the Scheme.</li>
			<li>Upon gaining approval the valve must meet the schemes audit 
			requirements (performance tested twice within the 5 year approval 
			period).</li>
		</ul>
					<p>Applications for approval can be made by the manufacturer (Full 
		Approval) or by a supplier (Factored Approval). In either case an 
		Application From must be submitted, please contact a member of the
		<a href="contact_details.htm">BuildCert Team</a> if you require any 
		assistance with your application.</p>

  <h2 class=" bg-danger" style="padding:5px;">Notes on Quality Requirements</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers of Thermostatic mixing valves can demonstrate 
		compliance by supplying the Scheme with a copy of a valid ISO 9001 
		certificate and scope of accreditation or an approved quality system. 
		Where this cannot be supplied a quality audit will be conducted by the 
		scheme to verify compliance with the requirements of the Scheme.</p><p>
		A 
		Primary factor is a company/individual who does not manufacture the 
		valve but distributes a certified valve under his own trade name, the 
		product having only cosmetic changes. An approval for the primary factor 
		is sometimes referred to as a piggyback approval.&nbsp;<!-- #EndEditable -->
