      <p>
      Approved Document G - Sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency (2009 Edition) of the Building Regulations in England and Wales requires that the hot water outlet to a bath should be limited to 48 &#x2103; It states that valves conforming to BS EN 1111 or BS EN 1287 are suitable for this purpose. Similar requirements exist in Scotland. 
      </p>  <p>TMV2 approval is for the domestic thermostatic sector and uses BS EN 1111 and BS EN1287 as a basis for the thermostatic valves performance testing. </p>

						</li>
						<li>
							All valves must have WRAS approval before TMV2 approval can be 			issued or the non-metallic materials in contact with water comply			with the WRAS requirements or comply with BS6920.
						</li>
						<li>
							The installation and maintenance documents (I&amp;M) must include 			specific information stated by the Scheme.
						</li>
						<li>
							Upon gaining approval the valve must meet the schemes audit 			requirements (performance tested twice within the 5 year approval 			period).
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Applications for approval can be made by the manufacturer (Full 		Approval) or by a supplier (Factored Approval). In either case an 		Application From must be submitted, please contact a member of the <a href="#contact">BuildCert Team</a> if you require any 		assistance with your application.

  <h2 class=" bg-warning" style="padding:5px;">Notes on Quality Requirements</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers of Thermostatic mixing valves can demonstrate compliance by supplying the Scheme with a copy of a valid ISO 9001 certificate and scope of accreditation or an approved quality system. Where this cannot be supplied a quality audit will be conducted by the scheme to verify compliance with the requirements of the Scheme. </p>
  <p>
  A Primary factor is a company/individual who does not manufacture the valve but distributes a certified valve under his own trade name, the product having only cosmetic changes. An approval for the primary factor is sometimes referred to as a piggyback approval.
